# Overview
<p align="center"><img width="90%" src="1.png"/></p> 

We explore a novel task setting for text style transfer, in which it is required to simultaneously manipulate multiple Ô¨Åne-grained attributes. We propose to address it by revising the original sentences in a continuous space based on gradient-based optimization.

   
**We will release the code and data upon acceptance.**
